msyslog source code files have either traditional BSD license, on the
cases of files based on previous BSD syslog (syslogd.c, syslogd.h,
ttymsg.c and  om_classic.c), or a quite similar licence for the rest
of the source files. the only difference is that the later doesn't
ask for acknowledge on advertizing materials.

the BSD license used is the following:

The other files use this similar licence:

Note the only difference is point 3 of the former is missing.


msyslog's developers intend to keep it on this licence's spirit forever.
