Installation
------------

Please read the file INSTALL.

About Modular Syslog
--------------------

This is a daemon for the syslog system log interface. It is based on OpenBSD's
syslog daemon implementation, with many improvements (ie. log hash protection).

This project is intended as a whole revision of previous Secure Syslogd
project (wich is unsupported by now). It has all functionalities and some
more. The remaining things are Solaris support and Audit compatibility
(on the works).

Reporting Bugs
--------------

Please send an email to core.devel.alat@core-sdi.com, describing the problem
the most you can, containing also machine description, hardware
description, the configuration file (/etc/syslog.conf), the OS
description, and the invoking command line.

The more you describe the bug, the faster we can fix it.

Known Bugs
----------

- Still no support for '!' and '=' on syslog.conf
- If a module blocks on I/O the hole daemon blocks, and messages can get lost
  on extremely busy hosts.


Main differences with previous BSD syslog
-----------------------------------------

The whole internal structure was redesigned to work with input and output modules,
standarizing interfaces to facilitate development for using special devices and
flexible configurations.

Special care was taken to remain backwards compatible on configuration files.
You can use you previous BSD config files with this improved version of syslog.
A new notation was made for configuration of modules.

This new approach allows adding new functionality without complicating the code.

Current available output modules are classic, mysql, peo, pgsql and regex.
Available input modules are bsd, linux, unix, and udp. Current modules under
development or in the makings range from tcp transport, to a special module
for setting up triggers on actions and priority redirection.


Classic Output Module
---------------------

Performs the previous BSD syslogd output tasks: save to a file, forward
to a remote host though UDP, mail a user, send a message to a console,
send a message to a tty, send message to all users (WALL).

MySQL Output Module
-------------------

Performs loggin in a MySQL server, either local or remote. The table format
must be specified as om_mysql(8) manpage specifies.


PostgreSQL Output Module
-------------------

Performs loggin in a PostgreSQL server, either local or remote. Since this
module is similar to the MySQL one, the table format must be specified as
om_mysql(8) manpage specifies.

Regular Expression Output Module
--------------------------------

This module acts as a filter, applying a regular expression to a message,
hour, date or host. If message matches all, the next module in the
configuration file is called. If reverse flag is used, pass all but matching
messages. See om_regex(8) manpage for more details.

Peo Output Module
-----------------

This module does hash protection on logs. See om_peo(8) manpage for
more information on useage.

BSD Input Module
----------------

Gets messages from a BSD special kernel logging device. Use it simply
as this on command line -i /dev/klog.

Linux Input Module
------------------

Gets messages from a Linux special kernel logging device. Read im_linux(8)
manpage for more details.

UDP Input Module
----------------

Read messages from an UDP socket. Use it simply as this on command line
-i udp <port number>. The port number is optional, and default is
the one specified on /etc/services for "udp" and "syslog".

Unix Input Module
-----------------

Reads messages from a unix domain socket. Use it simply as this on command
line -i 'unix /dev/log' or -i unix:/dev/log.

Streams Input Module
--------------------

This module handles stream devices (Solaris, and other SYSV like). Invoke
on command line like this -i streams or -i streams:/dev/log (or equivalent).
Note: this module may require Doors input module to work.

Doors Input Module
------------------

May be needed on for other input modules. Invoke it like this on command
line -i doors or -i doors:/etc/.syslog_door (or equivalent).
