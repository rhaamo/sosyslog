Main differences with previous BSD syslog
-----------------------------------------

The whole internal structure was redesigned to work with input and output modules,
standarizing interfaces to facilitate development for using special devices and
flexible configurations.

Special care was taken to remain backwards compatible on configuration files.
You can use you previous BSD config files with this improved version of syslog.
A new notation was made for configuration of modules.

This new approach allows adding new functionality without complicating the code.

Current availble outout modules are classic, mysql, peo, pgsql and regex.
Available input modules are bsd, linux, unix, and udp. Current modules under
development or in the makings range from tcp connections, to a special module
for setting up triggers on actions and priority redirection.
