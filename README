Main differences with previous BSD syslog
-----------------------------------------

The whole internal structure was redesigned to work with input and output
modules, standarizing interfaces to facilitate development for using special
logging targets and flexible configuratios.

Special care was taken to remain backwards compatible on config files. You can
use you previous BSD config files with this improved version of syslog. A new
notation was made for configuration of modules.

This new approach allows adding new functionality without complicating the
code.

Current availble output modules are classic, peo, regex, mysql and pgsql.
Available input modules are bsd, unix, udp, linux.
