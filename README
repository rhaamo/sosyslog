Main differences with previous BSD syslog
-----------------------------------------

The whole internal structure was redesigned to work with inpput and output modules,
standarizing interfaces to facilitate development for using special devices and
flexible configuratios.

Special care was taken to remain backwards compatible on config files. You can
use you previous BSD config files with this improved version of syslog. A new
notation was made for configuration of modules.

This new approach allows adding new functionality without complicating the code.

Current availble outout modules are classic, mysql, peo, pgsql and regex.
Available input modules are bsd, unix, udp, linux, and tcp.
