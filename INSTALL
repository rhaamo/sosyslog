                         Modular Syslog package
                             INSTALL file
								
                 (C)2000, 2001 Core-SDI. Buenos Aires, Argentina.
==============================================================================

  This file describes how to compile and install modular syslog.

  Msyslog has been tested on the following platforms:

	- OpenBSD 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0
	- RedHat 6.2, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2
	- Debian Potato
	- Solaris 7, 8
	- Irix64 6.5
	- Aix 4.3





SPECIAL NOTE
------------

Most of the documentation and examples are on the manual pages provided.
They are meant to be the ultimate reference. See im_bsd.8, im_linux.8
im_udp.8, om_mysql.8, om_regex.8, peochk.8 im_doors.8, im_streams.8
im_unix.8, om_peo.8, om_tcp.8, syslog.conf.5, im_file.8, im_tcp.8
om_classic.8, om_pgsql.8, om_udp.8, and syslogd.8.


0. Packages
===========

There are Debian packages you can use with Debian's apt_get and friends.
(ie. apt_get msyslog)

There are Redhat packages at the Sourceforge page. Those are built for
now by Florin Andrei.

In the future we plan to have the package creation of RedHat, Debian,
OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Solaris in the source tree. It would be done
with some make target like 'make rpm'.


1. Compiling
============
 
1.a. Getting the last version

  The last version of the secure syslog package will always be available
at http://www.corest.com/english/freesoft.html. You may want to check
out for a new release before installing.
  The distribution file should look like 'msyslog-X.XX.tar.gz'. Where
X.XX stands for version number (i.e. 'msyslog-0.99.tar.gz'). You will
need also the GNU gunzip command in order to decompress it.


1.b. Extracting the sources 
  
  Change directory to a directory you have write permissions on and type:
		
		gunzip msyslog-X.XX.tar.gz
		tar xvf msyslog-X.XX.tar

  The words msyslog-X.XX.tar.gz and msyslog-X.XX.tar should be replaced
with full pathnames, if necesary.

  This will create a directory named msyslog-X.XX where all the sources
are placed. All other steps assume you are on that directory.


1.c. Configuring 

  The modules are now automatically configured (since 1.04 version). You
only have to be sure the libraries you need are on the ld path. For example,
for MySQL you have to check your libmysqlclient.so.X.X is on you library path.
For mor information see your MySQL install docs.

  You must run the script "configure" to prepare the compilation headers and
makefiles for your system.

  The standard distribution will be installed on /usr/local directory, to
change this, you may specify prefix when running configure (ie.:
"configure --prefix=/usr").

  NOTE: If you are compiling on a new OS you may want to start a new
configuration file, using the autoconf package available at
http://www.gnu.org/. We would like to help new plataform ports, please
contact the developer's mailing list (see note on mailing-lists). It should be
quite easy, since most branches of the *nix family tree are working already.


1.d. Compiling

  Execute:
		make clean
		make

  Login as root and execute:
		make install

  If you successfully compile on a new platform not listed above, please
contact the developers in order to include the changes in the official
distribution (see note on contacting us below).

	
2. PLATAFORM SPECIFIC NOTES
===========================

2.a Linux

  Before starting msyslog, first stop running the old syslogd and also
stop running klogd.


3. MODULE SPECIFIC NOTES
===========================

3.a PEO

  See om_peo(8), peochk(8) and syslog.conf(5) manpages for details and
proper setup instructions.

3.b MySQL

  If your libmysqlclient library isn't in your linker path, you must
add the corresponding directory on the shell variable LD_PATH.

  See "om_mysql" manpage for details and proper setup instructions.

3.c PostgreSQL

  If your libpq library isn't in your linker path, you must add the
corresponding directory on the shell variable LD_PATH.

  See "om_pgsql" manpage for details and proper setup instructions.


4. HOW TO CONTACT US AND RELATED MAILING LISTS
==============================================

  There are two mailing lists for msyslog:

    msyslog-usr 
        This mailing list is for general discussions about the
        modular syslog system.

    msyslog-dev 
        This mailing list is for technical discussions about
        the modular syslog system.  It's intended for
        developers or any other person interested in the inner
        working parts of msyslog.

  Send a message to majordomo@corest.com with the text:

subscribe list-name

in the message body, replacing list-name by the name of the
choosen list. You can also send an email to  the developers only
at core.devel.alat@corest.com.
