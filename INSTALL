                         Modular Syslog package
                             INSTALL file
								
                 (C)2000 Core-SDI. Buenos Aires, Argentina.
==============================================================================

  This file describes how to compile and install modular syslog both auditor
and server.	


         ------- WARNING: THIS IS A PRE-RELEASE VERSION ---------

  Altought this system has been tested for a while on several platforms,
it still considered to be on a beta stage. If you are seriously considering
using it on a exposed enviroment, wait for a release version.

		
  Msyslog has been tested on the following platforms:

	- OpenBSD 2.6, 2.7
	- Linux RedHat 6.2
	- Caldera OpenLinux 2.2


1. Compiling
============
 
1.a. Getting the last version

  The last version of the secure syslog package will always be available
at http://www.core-sdi.com/english/freesoft.html. You may want to check
out for a new release before installing.
  The distribution file should look like 'msyslog-X.XX.tar.gz'. Where
X.XX stands for version number (i.e. 'msyslog-0.99.tar.gz'). You will
need also the GNU gunzip command in order to decompress it.


1.b. Extracting the sources 
  
  Change directory to a directory you have write permissions on and type:
		
		gunzip msyslog-X.XX.tar.gz
		tar xvf msyslog-X.XX.tar

  The words msyslog-X.XX.tar.gz and msyslog-X.XX.tar should be replaced
with full pathnames, if necesary.


1.c. Configuring 

  Edit the file named modules.conf to match your criteria. Look at the
following example:

	UNIX=static
	BSD=static
	LINUX=
	UDP=static
	CLASSIC=static
	PEO=static
	REGEX=static
	MYSQL=
	PGSQL=

  When you want a specific module, you have to put the word 'static'
or 'dynamic' on it's value. Dynamic modules are useful for vendor
specific modules, or to save memory on systems with more than one
msyslog daemon running; if you won't a module, just leave it without
asignment.

  Then, you must run the script "configure" to prepare the compilation
headers and Makefiles for your system. You can also specify the include
and lib paths for mysql and pgsql modules (run "configure --help" for
more information).

  The standard distribution will be installed on /usr/local directory,
to change this, you may specify prefix when running configure (ie.:
"configure --prefix=/usr".

  You must run "configure" each time you modify modules.conf file.

  NOTE: If you are compiling on a new OS you may want to start a new
configuration file, using the autoconf package available at
http://www.gnu.org/. We would like to help new plataform ports, please
contact the developer's mailing list (see note on mailing-lists).


1.d. Compiling

  If you are compiling both client auditor and server.
  Execute:
		make clean
		make

  Login as root and execute:
		make install

  If you successfully compile on a new platform not listed above,
please contact the developers in order to include the changes in the 
official distribution (see note on contacting us below).

	
2. PLATAFORM SPECIFIC NOTES
===========================

2.a Linux

  Under Linux you need to have 'LINUX' module activated (either static or
  dynamic) to log kernel messages; this module acts like klogd daemon so,
  if you have it installed on your system, you should kill it before
  running msyslog, otherwise im_linux will conflict with it.
  The 'BSD' module is the kernel logguer on bsd-like system, you should
  not to activate it on Linux.


3. MODULE SPECIFIC NOTES
===========================

3.a PEO

  See manpage details for proper setup instructions.

3.b MySQL

  If your libmysqlclient library isn't in your linker path, you must
add the corresponding directory on the shell variable LD_PATH.
  See manpage details for proper setup instructions.

3.c PostgreSQL

  If your libpq library isn't in your linker path, you must add the
corresponding directory on the shell variable LD_PATH.
  See manpage details for proper setup instructions.


4. HOW TO CONTACT US AND RELATED MAILING LISTS
==============================================

  There are two mailing lists for msyslog:

    msyslog-usr 
        This mailing list is for general discussions about the
        modular syslog system.

    msyslog-dev 
        This mailing list is for technical discussions about
        the modular syslog system.  It's intended for
        developers or any other person interested in the inner
        working parts of msyslog.

To subscribe to any of this lists click on the choosen list above
or send a message to majordomo@core-sdi.com with the text:

subscribe list-name

in the message body, replacing list-name by the name of the
choosen list. You can also send an email to  the developers only
at core.devel.alat@core-sdi.com.
