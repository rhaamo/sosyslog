Modular syslog daemon reads and logs messages to the system console, log
files, other machines and/or users as specified by its configuration
file. Several input and output modules are provided (with features like
log integrity checking -peo protocol-, output to postgresql, mysql, etc).
It is based on the OpenBSD's syslog daemon.
This package is intended for developers who want to build msyslog modules.
