			HOW TO WRITE A SYSLOGD MODULE
			=============================

First, it is recommended that you use the templates for module creations,
im_myodule.c and om_mymodule.c. Take care with getopt optreset present
on some OSs.

Some extra care should be taken of repeated messages too.

Names
-----

Names used should be alphanumeric using '_' as separation.


Timer function
--------------

Currently msyslog supports a special timer function for input modules. You
only need to create it named im_mymodule_timer and set on im_mymodule_init
the "next" structure to match the first time this function would be called.
And every time the function is called, it must set the next time to be
called.

It is not guaranteed that it will be called at that precise time, but that
it will NOT be called before it.

Libraries
---------

You must specify all needed libraries in "src/modules_libs.c".
