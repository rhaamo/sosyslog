			HOW TO WRITE A SYSLOGD MODULE
			=============================

First, it is recommended that you use the templates for module creations,
im_myodule.c and om_mymodule.c. Take care with getopt optreset present
on some OSs.

Some extra care should be taken of repeated messages too.

Names
-----

Names used should be alphanumeric using '_' as separation.

Libraries
---------

Your module should handle it's libraries with dlopen() and dlsym().
