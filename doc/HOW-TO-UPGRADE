OpenBSD
=======

Uncompress msyslog-1.04.tar.gz and do a "./configure" and then a "make".
If everything goes well (it should! ;), do a "make install".

This version of "msyslog" is full compatible with previous configuration files
from BSD syslog and sysklogd's.

RedHat GNU/Linux
================

You need /proc filesystem to let im_linux work.

FreeBSD
=======

No thorough testing yet, so no help available yet. But everything should work
just fine.

NetBSD
======

No thorough testing yet, so no help available yet. But everythyng should work
just fine.


Solaris
=======

Specific differences on configuration file not supported (like 'ifdef'
conditionals).


Irix
====

You may compile with -O3 level, but it is not default.

Aix
===

Check your library settings, since it is ugly on Aix!
