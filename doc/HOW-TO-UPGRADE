OpenBSD
=======

VERSION WARNING: only tested on OpenBSD 2.6/27, and RedHat 6.0.
RUNNING WARNING: Now you MUST specify "-i bsd", it isn't default. comments?


Uncompress msyslog-0.9a.tar.gz and do a "./configure" and then a "make".
If everything goes well (it should! ;), do a "make install".

This version of "msyslog" is full compatible with previous configuration files
from BSD syslog.

Change /etc/rc.conf line of syslogd to simething like: '-i bsd -i unix:/dev/log'

RedHat GNU/Linux
================

Take care with special Linux configuration file enhancements. Some are yet to be
supported by msyslog. 

Also there is a module under developmente for replacing klogd's functionality
with kernel. Meanwhile keep using klogd.

FreeBSD

just fine.
