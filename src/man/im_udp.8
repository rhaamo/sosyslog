.Sh NAME
.Nm UDP input module
.Nd
.Xr syslogd 8
input module for UDP network logging
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm udp
.Op Ar port
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Listens on an UDP port for incoming log messages for the
.Xr syslogd 8
daemon. The options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar port
On which port to listen. Per default
.Nm im_udp
uses whatever getservbyname("syslog", "udp")
returns, which in turn usually looks this up in
.Pa /etc/services .
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -bullet
.It
The following command starts the
.Xr syslogd 8
daemon and logs UDP logging information coming in on the default port only:
.Pp
.Dl syslogd -i udp
.Pp
.It
This does the same as above, but listens on port 1777 instead:
.Pp
.Dl syslogd -i udp:1777
