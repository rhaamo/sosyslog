.Sh NAME
.Nm PostgreSQL output module
.Nd
.Xr syslogd 8
output module used to log on PostgreSQL servers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pgsql
.Op Fl s Ar host<:port>
.Op Fl u Ar username
.Op Fl p Ar password
.Op Fl d Ar database
.Op Fl t Ar table
.Op Fl F
.Op Fl P
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm PostgreSQL output module 
receives a message as an ascii string and logs it on a PostgreSQL server. For
proper initialization, the following parameters should be set:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s Ar hostname<:port>
Specify the PostgreSQL server hostname and optionally the port.
.It Fl u Ar username
Specifies the username to use on the PostgreSQL server. This user
must have enough permissions to insert on the specified database and table.
.It Fl p Ar password
The plaintext password for this PostgreSQL user. Thus it is recommended NOT to
leave
.Xr syslog.conf 5
world readable if this module is used.
.It Fl d Ar database
The database name to use on the specified PostgreSQL server.
.It Fl t Ar table
The table name to use on the specified PostgreSQL database.
.It Fl F
Insert the facility level name on the table on a field named "facility"
.It Fl P
Insert the priority level name on the table on a field named "priority"
.Sh EXAMPLES
Example entry for
.Xr syslog.conf 5
:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
  *.*     %pgsql -s logger.mydomain.edu \e
          -u loguser -p loguserpassword \e
	  -d syslogDB -t syslogTB
.Pp
The table should have a format like this:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
  CREATE TABLE syslogTB (
    facility char(10),
    priority char(10),
    date date,
    time time,
    host varchar(128),
    message  text
  );
.Ed
.Pp
The field names should be resected. The type of fields
.Va host
and
.Va msg
can be any text format smaller than 128 and 1024 chars respectively.

.Sh BUGS
.Bl -bullet
.It
Since the PostgreSQL module is used to connect with username and password,
care must be pointed on file permissions and that user permissions
on the PostgreSQL server.
