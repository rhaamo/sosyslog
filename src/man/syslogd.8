.Sh NAME
modular
.Nm syslogd
.Nd log systems messages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm syslogd
.Op Fl du
.Op Fl f Ar config_file
.Op Fl m Ar mark_interval
.Op Fl a Ar path
.Op Fl p Ar log_socket
.Op Fl i Ar input
.Fl i Ar input
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Modular
.Nm syslogd
reads and logs messages to the system console, log files, other
machines and/or users as specified by its configuration file.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Enable debugging to the standard output,
and do not disassociate from the controlling terminal.
.It Fl f Ar config_file
Specify the pathname of an alternate configuration file;
the default is
.Pa /etc/syslog.conf .
.It Fl m Ar mark_interval
Select the number of minutes between ``mark'' messages;
the default is 20 minutes.
.It Fl u
Allow the historical ``insecure'' mode, in which syslogd will
accept input from the UDP port as specified in
.Pa /etc/services .
Some software wants this, but you can be subjected to a variety of
attacks over the network, including attackers remotely filling logs.
.It Fl p Ar log_socket
Specify the pathname of an alternate log socket to be used instead;
the default is
.Pa /dev/log .
This option is deprecated by
.Fl i
option.
.It Fl a Pa path
Specify a location where
.Nm syslogd
should place an additional log socket.
The primary use for this is to place additional log sockets in
.Pa /dev/log
of various chroot filespaces. This option is predecated by
.Fl i
option.
.It Fl i Ar input
Enables the specified input modules; values for
.Ar input
are
.Cm bsd,
used on BSD like systems to log kernel messages (from
.Pa /dev/klog
),
and 
.Cm unix,
used to log standard messages, you should specify the input socket
pathname following a ``:'' character (historically
.Pa /dev/log
).
.El
.Pp
.Nm Syslogd
reads its configuration file when it starts up and whenever it
receives a hangup signal.
For information on the format of the configuration file,
see
.Xr syslog.conf 5 .
.Pp
.Nm Syslogd
creates the file
.Pa /var/run/syslog.pid ,
and stores its process
id there.
This can be used to kill or reconfigure
.Nm syslogd .
.Pp
The message sent to
.Nm syslogd
should consist of a single line.
The message can contain a priority code, which should be a preceding
decimal number in angle braces, for example,
.Sq Aq 5 .
This priority code should map into the priorities defined in the
include file
.Aq Pa sys/syslog.h .
.Sh EXAMPLES
To run modular
.Nm
on bsd systems you should:
.Pp
.Dl # syslogd -i bsd -i unix:/dev/log
.Pp
with the command above two inputs modules are created,
.Cm bsd,
that logs kernel messages from
.Pa /dev/klog,
and
.Cm unix,
that opens
.Pa /dev/log
socket to log standard messages.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/syslog.pid -compact
.It Pa /etc/syslog.conf
The configuration file.
.It Pa /var/run/syslog.pid
The process id of current
.Nm syslogd .
.It Pa /dev/log
Name of the
.Tn UNIX
domain datagram log socket.
.It Pa /dev/klog
The kernel log device.
