Things to do:

- AIX port
- DB2 output module
- Check "" errors on solaris / support spaces intead the tabs on configfile
- Change strcpy and strncpy to strlcpy (same w/ strlcat)
- define STYLE for names (ie. underscore or caps, indentation)
- Check linux kernel 2.4 potential header problems
- redo parsing functions
- CHECK LIBC and GLIBC's way to work
- More docs on source code
- unify documentation
- use more cache on autoconf

FOR FUTURE WORKING

For handling errors logging in a particular module, create a om_onerror
function to do proper reinit or whatever (and after that the module should
get in the exactly same state as before the error).

Check for buffer overflows, as we now may get things from the outside world.

- finish log structure stuff, including some queue handling
- divide classic in om_file, om_udp, om_console, om_wall, om_user.
- We need to change the decode function on syslogd.c and use the strcasecmp()
  function
- Kill filed structure, associate ins and outs so no for(;;) is needed
- Optimize each input/output module
- Complete and fix man pages
- create a single file with all networking primitives used
- chroot
- new syntax on config files
- debug levels
- redo line format while keeping "<" and ">" usage (prevent new syslog proto)
- Allow not only one module type on each configuration line (what?)
- Add linux extensions on selector field on configuration file
- We need to allow several others log methods like syscalls (ex.: im_linux)
- Reconfiguing input modules on the fly (syslog -i "unix /dev/klog" when
  syslog is already running)
- Keep alive [remote] saying how many messages have been sent from the previous
  keep alive
- optimize peochk (readline)
- Create a module configuration file outside /etc/syslog.conf
- threads per output module
- Debug levels. A better macro. No need of newlines.
- Create a message structure to be pased from ins to outs
- Make a dbm/ndbm output module. talk w/ audit for that
- Check why messages to console take a while to pop up
- Support Linux's ! != etc syslog.conf format
- A bug report form
- check M$ MAPI
- check pager stuff formats
