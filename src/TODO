Things to do:

- do not generate coredumps (via resource limits)
- check pager stuff formats
- check M$ MAPI
- thinker about wall mesages
- abstract a *net.c fileall networking code ?
- debug levels
- redo line format while keeping "<" and ">" usage (prevent new syslog proto)
- minimize global variables even more
- CHECK LIBC and GLIBC's way to work

FOR FUTURE WORKING

For handling errors logging in a particular module, create a om_onerror
function to do proper reinit or whatever (and after that the module should
get in the exactly same state as before the error).

Check for buffer overflows, as we now may get things from the outside world.

- We need to change the decode function on syslogd.c and use the strcasecmp()
  function
- Kill filed structure
- Optimize each input/output module
- Create goods Makefiles
- Complete and fix man pages
- Allow not only one module type on each configuration line
- Add linux extensions on selector field on configuration file
- We can't do select when im->path = NULL and im->fd >= 0 but the module
  should be called.
  We need to allow several others log methods like syscalls (ex.: im_linux)
- Reconfiguing input modules on the fly (syslog -i "unix /dev/kklog" when
  syslog is already running)
- Keep alive [remote] saying how many messages have been sent from the previous
  keep alive
- optimize peochk (readline)
- Create a module configuration file outside /etc/syslog.conf
- warn if configuration line is wrong
- what to do with SQL down ?
- threads per output module
- Debug levels. A better macro. No need of newlines.
- Make om_classic accept other ports for UDP forwarding.
- Remove all strdup we have. they are error-prone
- Preocess -a option better/nicer
- Check repeateds on mysql, also size of messages... check sql_misc too.
