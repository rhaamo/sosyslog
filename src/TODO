FOR THIS RELEASE

- More docs on source code
- unify documentation

FOR NEXT RELEASE

- finish log structure stuff, including some queue handling
	- after that, improve om_regex, and join reduntant code.
	- have in mind new standards
- Move buffer of lost messages out of modules, so all om can use it.
- Check "" errors on solaris / support spaces intead the tabs on configfile
- Change strcpy and strncpy to strlcpy (same w/ strlcat)
- define STYLE for names (ie. underscore or caps, indentation)
- redo parsing functions
- CHECK LIBC and GLIBC's way to work
- use more cache on autoconf
- %subst module
- Make source compile on non gcc systems.
- Makefiles should let compile a single module as a .so

FOR UNKNOWN FUTURE

- Use one function per module, with action as a parameter.
- Check linux kernel 2.4 potential header problems
- Let im_tcp do the connect, and om_tcp do the listen.

For handling errors logging in a particular module, create a om_onerror
function to do proper reinit or whatever (and after that the module should
get in the exactly same state as before the error).

Check for buffer overflows, as we now may get things from the outside world.

- divide classic in om_file, om_udp, om_console, om_wall, om_user.
- We need to change the decode function on syslogd.c and use the strcasecmp()
  function
- Kill filed structure, associate ins and outs so no for(;;) is needed
- Optimize each input/output module
- Complete and fix man pages
- create a single file with all networking primitives used
- chroot
- new syntax on config files
- debug levels
- redo line format while keeping "<" and ">" usage (prevent new syslog proto)
- Allow not only one module type on each configuration line (what?)
- Add linux extensions on selector field on configuration file
- We need to allow several others log methods like syscalls (ex.: im_linux)
- Reconfiguing input modules on the fly (syslog -i "unix /dev/klog" when
  syslog is already running)
- Keep alive [remote] saying how many messages have been sent from the previous
  keep alive
- optimize peochk (readline)
- Create a module configuration file outside /etc/syslog.conf
- threads per output module
- Create a message structure to be pased from ins to outs
- Make a dbm/ndbm output module. talk w/ audit for that
- Check why messages to console take a while to pop up
- Support Linux's ! != etc syslog.conf format
- A bug report form
- check M$ MAPI
- check pager stuff formats
