Things to do:

- check pager stuff formats
- check M$ MAPI
- thinker about wall mesages
- abstract a *net.c fileall networking code ?
- debug levels
- redo line format while keeping "<" and ">" usage (prevent new syslog proto)
- minimize global variables even more
- CHECK LIBC and GLIBC's way to work

FOR FUTURE WORKING

For handling errors logging in a particular module, create a om_onerror
function to do proper reinit or whatever (and after that the module should
get in the exactly same state as before the error).

Check for buffer overflows, as we now may get things from the outside world.

- We need to change the decode function on syslogd.c and use the strcasecmp()
  function
- Kill filed structure
- Optimize each input/output module
- Create goods Makefiles
- Add linux extensions on selector field on configuration file
- We can't do select when im->path = NULL and im->fd >= 0 but the module
  should be called.
  We need to allow several others log methods like syscalls (ex.: im_linux)
- Reconfiguing input modules on the fly (syslog -i "unix /dev/kklog" when
  syslog is already running)
- Keep alive [remote] saying how many messages have been sent from the previous
  keep alive
- optimize peochk (readline)


BUGS TO FIX

- check permissions on syslogd.conf and all other files
- thinker a bit more about mysql and pgsql passwords
- repeats on doLog and not other places
- only install manpages of installed modules
