Things to do:

- do not generate coredumps (via resource limits)
- check pager stuff formats
- check M$ MAPI
- thinker about wall mesages
- abstract a *net.c fileall networking code ?
- debug levels
- redo line format while keeping "<" and ">" usage (prevent new syslog proto)
- minimize global variables even more
- CHECK LIBC and GLIBC's way to work
- program execution module
- finish modularization and classic module
- change initialization, write modules om_init()
- create 'program' module
- redo parsing of config using isspace
- change static linking to some configurable dynamic module handling
- take out unused includes on syslogd.c
- think some way to specify multiple modules on syslog.conf
- Check configuration parsing, there is at least 1 buffer overflow
- remove or at least integrate consfile using and creation

FOR FUTURE WORKING

For handling errors logging in a particular module, create a om_onerror
function to do proper reinit or whatever (and after that the module should
get in the exactly same state as before the error).

Check for buffer overflows, as we now may get things from the outside world.

- We need to change the decode function on syslogd.c and use the strcasecmp()
  function
- Modules initialization should be dinamic
- Kill filed structure
- Optimize each input/output module
- Create goods Makefiles
- Complete and fix man pages
- Udp input module from an arbitrary port
- Allow not only one module type on each configuration line
- Add linux extensions on selector field on configuration file
- Add support to log on linux pseudo terminals (pts/x)
  (UPDATE: not really good)
- We can't do select when im->path = NULL and im->fd >= 0 but the module
  should be called.
  We need to allow several others log methods like syscalls (ex.: im_linux)
  Problem: klogctl syscall con linux blocks until the kernel logs something,
  a signal should be used to stop this block
- A script to generate a static_modules.h and set an array of structs there for
  each static module.
- Improve om_filter so it can rewrite messages. maybe resend to input.
  im_filter?
- Reconfiguing input modules on the fly (syslog -i "unix /dev/kklog" when
  syslog is already running)
