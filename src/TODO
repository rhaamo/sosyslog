Things to do:

- solaris port
- finish log structure stuff, including some queue handling
- do not generate coredumps (via resource limits)
- divide classic in om_file, om_udp, om_console, om_wall, om_user.
- warn the when ignoring a line
- define STYLE for names (ie. underscore or caps)
- tell about -i linux in syslogd(8)
- fix time and date usage on syslogd.c and modules. it is UGLY.
- thinker about wall mesages
- create a single file with all networking primitives used
- debug levels
- redo line format while keeping "<" and ">" usage (prevent new syslog proto)
- minimize global variables even more
- check pager stuff formats
- check M$ MAPI
- CHECK LIBC and GLIBC's way to work

FOR FUTURE WORKING

For handling errors logging in a particular module, create a om_onerror
function to do proper reinit or whatever (and after that the module should
get in the exactly same state as before the error).

Check for buffer overflows, as we now may get things from the outside world.

- We need to change the decode function on syslogd.c and use the strcasecmp()
  function
- Kill filed structure, associate ins and outs so no for(;;) is needed
- Optimize each input/output module
- Create good Makefiles
- Complete and fix man pages
- Allow not only one module type on each configuration line
- Add linux extensions on selector field on configuration file
- We can't do select when im->path = NULL and im->fd >= 0 but the module
  should be called.
  We need to allow several others log methods like syscalls (ex.: im_linux)
- Reconfiguing input modules on the fly (syslog -i "unix /dev/kklog" when
  syslog is already running)
- Keep alive [remote] saying how many messages have been sent from the previous
  keep alive
- optimize peochk (readline)
- Create a module configuration file outside /etc/syslog.conf
- warn if configuration line is wrong
- what to do with SQL down ?
- threads per output module
- Debug levels. A better macro. No need of newlines.
- Make om_classic accept other ports for UDP forwarding.
- Remove all strdup we have. they are error-prone
- Preocess -a option better/nicer
- Check repeateds on mysql, also size of messages... check sql_misc too.
- Create a message structure to be pased from ins to outs
- Make a dbm/ndbm output module. talk w/ audit for that
- Make syslogd's cfline more verbose on errors
- src/Makefile should warn if modules.conf changed to use ./configure
- Check why messages to console take a while to pop up
